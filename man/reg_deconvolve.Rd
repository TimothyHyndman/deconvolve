\title{Compute the measurement error version of the Nadaraya-Watson regression
estimator}
\usage{
reg_deconvolve(Y, W, W2 = NULL, xx = seq(min(W), max(W), length.out = 100),
  errortype = NULL, sd_U = NULL, phiU = NULL, bw = NULL, rho = NULL,
  n_cores = NULL, kernel_type = c("default", "normal", "sinc"),
  seed = NULL, use_alt_SIMEX_rep_opt = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A vector of the response data Y_1, ..., Y_n.}

\item{W}{A vector of the univariate contaminated data W_1, ..., W_n.}

\item{W2}{A vector of replicate measurements. If supplied, then the error 
will be estimated using replicates.}

\item{xx}{A vector of x values on which to compute the regression estimator.}

\item{errortype}{The distribution type of \eqn{U}. Either "laplace" or
"normal". If you define the errors this way then you must also provide
\code{sd_U} but should not provide \code{phiU}. Argument is case-insensitive
and partially matched.}

\item{sd_U}{The standard deviation of \eqn{U}. This does not need to be
provided if you define your error using phiU and provide \code{bw} and
\code{rho}.}

\item{phiU}{A function giving the characteristic function of \eqn{U}. You 
should only define the errors this way if you also provide \code{bw} and 
\code{rho}. If you define the errors this way then you should not provide 
\code{errortype}.}

\item{bw}{The bandwidth to use. If you provide this then you should also
provide \code{rho}.}

\item{rho}{The ridge parameter to use. If you provide this then you should
also provide \code{bw}.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores to use when calculating the bandwidth. If
\code{NULL}, the number of cores to use will be automatically detected.}

\item{kernel_type}{The deconvolution kernel to use. The default kernel has
characteristic function \eqn{(1-t^2)^3}.}

\item{seed}{Set seed for SIMEX. Otherwise a default seed will be automatically set.}

\item{use_alt_SIMEX_rep_opt}{Only used with SIMEX using replicates. If 
\code{TRUE}, performs SIMEX on \eqn{W = (W1 + W2)/2} and samples \eqn{U*} 
from (W1 - W2). The default performs SIMEX on \eqn{W = (W1, W2)} and 
and samples \eqn{U*} from \eqn{(W1 - W2)/\sqrt 2}.}
}
\value{
An object of class deconvolve containing the regression estimator, 
as well as the bandwidth and ridge parameter rho. Using SIMEX to choose 
smoothing-parameters. See Delaigle and Hall 2008.
}
\description{
Estimates \eqn{m(x) = E[Y | X = x]} from data \eqn{(W, Y)} where 
\eqn{W = X + U}.
}
\details{
#' The function \code{reg_deconvolve} chooses from one of two different 
methods depending on how the error distribution is defined.

\strong{Error from Replicates:} If both \code{W} and \code{W2} are supplied 
then the error is calculated using replicates. This method was prototyped in  
Delaigle, Hall, and Meister 2008 and then further refined in Delaigle and  
Hall 2016, and Camirand, Carroll, and Delaigle 2018.

\strong{Homoscedastic Error:} If the errors are defined by either a single 
function \code{phiU}, or a single value \code{sd_U} along with its 
\code{errortype} then the method used is as described in Fan and Truong 1993.
}
\section{Warnings}{

\itemize{
\item If provided, the bandwidth \code{h} and ridge parameter \code{rho} need
to be consistent. You should either provide both or neither.
\item The estimator can also be computed using the Fast Fourier Transform,
which is faster, but more complex. See Delaigle and Gijbels 2007.
